			<p>If I had to describe my time in Argentina in one word I would say it was a rebirth. But before I get too metaphorical, I need to explain how I got to Argentina in the first place. </p>
			<p>
			It was the spring term of my sophomore year and I was convinced that I was going to go to South Africa for a summer internship. However, I had to totally change my plans because the South African embassy was not emitting visas. Carleton’s Career Center, in conjunction with Connect123, gave me two options: I could either go to Argentina or try to get a visa for Dublin. Considering that I was already tired of dealing with so much paperwork, I decided to go to Latin America. To be honest, I was somewhat disappointed because I wanted to go out of my comfort zone and explore a new part of the world. However, I tried to keep an open mind. And this is how, in the summer of 2022, I spent two months in Buenos Aires working as an intern at Encontrarse en la Diversidad. As I wrote a thousand and one times on all the forms and questionnaires that I had to fill for Carleton’s Career Center, even though every day looked different at this NGO  “my main responsibilities included writing grant applications, translating press releases, and leading multiple diversity workshops in secondary schools, clubs, and socio-sports entities on issues of sexuality, gender, migration, violence, conflict resolution, and non-discrimination”. 
			</p>
			<p>Argentina exceeded all my expectations. I remember quite vividly how excited and comfortable I felt the first time I walked around Buenos Aires and saw kioskos, ripped political posters, and a graffiti with a phrase from Gustavo Cerati. I felt right away I was in Latin America and I cannot put into words how comforting it was to finally fit in somewhere after being in the US for a year. And for the most part, this feeling persisted throughout my time in Argentina. Nevertheless, as I started to talk more with my coworkers, I began to realize that my values, my habits, and even my language had become very American. This was a huge shock. I was too Latina to blend in the US and apparently, too Americanized to fully fit in Argentina. However, instead of making me feel isolated, this realization was a wake-up call to use my time in Argentina as the perfect opportunity to reconnect with that part of me that feels very Latin American. 
			</p>
			<p>And this is exactly what I did. I used every free afternoon that I had to explore Buenos Aires as much as possible: I participated in at least six free walking tours to learn about the history of the city, I went to a football game with one of my coworkers and became a fan of Racing Club, I tried every single brand of Alfajores that I could find, I learned how to drink mate, I went every Wednesday to Casa del Arbol to listen to underground music like a true local and I became very well-versed in Argentine slang. I can say that by the end of my internship, I felt like a different person. 
			</p>
			<p> I came to Argentina feeling burnt out and exhausted after being in a PWI for two years. I was disenchanted with academia and extremely tired of feeling like a constant outsider. However, when I left I felt inspired and empowered. Working at Encontrarse en la Diversidad made me fall in love again with political activism. Going to museums, theater plays, and informal toques helped me reconnect with my 15-year-old self (a very idealistic version of myself that was obsessed with Argentina rock and Julio Cortazar). And just living in Argentina helped me remember that Latin America represents resilience and creativity.</p>
			
			<h2>About this room</h2>
			<p>In this room, there is an old turntable that is permanently playing vinyl records of Cancion Animal by Soda Stereo, Giros by Fito Paez, and Elija Y Gane by Luis Alberto Spinetta, my three favorite rock albums, all by Argentine artists. Next to the turntable, there is an almost infinite pile of books from Julio Cortazar, Jorge Luis Borges, Ernesto Sabato and why not, a copy of Diarios de Motocicleta by Che Guevara. Of course, there is also a green bandana in honor of the Argentine feminist movement, and all the protests in Colombia that I have followed and supported, with deep sorrow and helplessness, while being abroad. There is also an unfinished mate (because even though I have been trying very hard to become an avid mate drinker I still struggle with its bitterness) and a bunch of messy papers that somehow represent all the poems, short stories, and biographical essays my experience in Argentina inspired me to write.
