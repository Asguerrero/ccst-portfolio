		<p>I was born in Neiva, a midsized city in the Andean region of Colombia. Nevertheless, when someone asks me where I am from I normally tell an innocent lie and say I am from Bogota. Given that I did live in Bogota from 2014 to 2018 (plus six extra months in 2021) and that this period coincides with the most formative years of my life, I feel somewhat entitled to claim it as my city. If I am talking to someone from Colombia, I sometimes reveal that I am from Neiva as a curious and almost superfluous fact. Most people do not even know where it is located so I have come to the conclusion that is pointless to explain exactly where I was born. However, it does not matter how much I try to simplify, everyone looks confused, especially if they are Colombian, when I mention that I lived in Putumayo for two years and that this is actually where my nuclear family currently lives.
		</p>

		<p>
		As my complicated answer to the question of where I am from reveals, my experiences in Colombia are divided between the three cities that I have lived in. Neiva represents my childhood. I remember it as the very warm city where I learned how to write, ride a bike, and appreciate rum with raisins ice cream, my grandmother’s favorite. Mocoa and Villagarzon (the two cities in Putumayo my family has lived in) represent my pre-teenage years. This is <em>La Colombia Profunda</em>, that part of Colombia where there are no paved roads or third-level hospitals, where everyone has a chilling story involving a guerrilla fighter or a paramilitary group, and where swimming in crystal clear water and finding an extremely poisonous snake is not something extraordinary, it is just a regular Saturday. Bogota, on the other hand, is the city that made me who I am. It is where I learned about the Latin American Boom, poetry, philosophy, and politics. It is where I learned about the history of the Colombian armed conflict and about Marx's infrastructure and superstructure. It was only during my time in Bogota that I started to understand the country I was born in and paradoxically, these same experiences are what made me a prime candidate for the scholarship that got me to Japan in 2018. But this is a different story that belongs to the next room. 
		</p>

		<p>As I once read while I was glancing over a poetry anthology from an author whose name I do not remember, it is easier to write a novel about a city you lived in for a couple of months than a couple of sentences about the place you were born in. This is exactly how I feel about Colombia. I cannot summarize the first 15 years of my life or what Colombia means to me in a single paragraph. However, I think these lines capture the essence of how I would describe my country and my Colombian identity. To me, Colombia is: 
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Where I spent my weekends as a child in a finca (farm) helping my grandmother convert cacao beans into the bitter chocolate that my family drinks for breakfast every morning</li>
			<li>The country that made me lose hope in 2016 when 50.2% of people rejected a peace agreement that promised to end a 60-year armed conflict that had left more than 9.423.138 victims. However, it is also the nation that made me believe in politics again when in 2022 we elected our first left-wing president, an ex-guerrilla fighter. </li>
			<li>Everything Calle 13 describes in his song Latinoamerica: la sobra de todo lo que se robaron, el desarrollo en carne viva, un pueblo sin piernas pero que camina (the leftovers of everything that was stolen, development in the flesh, a people without legs but that walks)</li>
			<li>An extremely unequal state where in 2022, while 40% of the population lived with a little bit more than 2 dollars a day, I had to confront my economic privilege as an international student from a middle-class family that could comfortably eat three meals a day. 
			<li> The place in which I unsuccessfully tried to learn how to dance salsa, merengue, and bachata and where my classmates taught me how to take aguardiente shots with a straight face</li>
			<li> A country with such a violent history that my chemistry teacher said I would see more blood as a journalist than as a doctor when I tried to explain to him that I did not want to pursue a career in medicine because I am scared of blood
			</li>
			<li> A country with such a violent history that my chemistry teacher said I would see more blood as a journalist than as a doctor when I tried to explain to him that I did not want to pursue a career in medicine because I am scared of blood
			</li> 
			<li>An extremely creative and resilient place where so many people are willing to sacrifice their lives, but not their principles, hasta que la dignidad se haga costumbre (until dignity becomes a habit)</li>
			<li>A surreal and almost magical nation where, to reference Gabriel Garcia Marquez, las estirpes condenadas a cien años de soledad merecen una segunda oportunidad sobre la tierra (the lineages condemned to one hundred years of solitude deserve a second chance on earth)
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>About this room</h2>
		<p>This room is the biggest room in my house. It is full of small objects that encapsulate all the good memories that I associate with Colombia. It contains, for instance, the orange swing I spent many afternoons playing with when I was a child and the baby teeth that my mom carefully kept when she pretended to be el Ratón Pérez (not the be confused with the fairy tooth). This is the room in which I have stored all the Christmas gifts that I so eagerly opened every December 24th (because in Colombia we celebrate Christmas on the 24th instead of the 25th). Of course, there is also a huge cabinet with all the food that I cherish so much: my grandmother’s handmade chocolate, archiras, plantains, and at least three bottles of aguardiente Doble Anís. Next to this cabinet, there is a huge library where I have carefully kept all the books that introduced me to Magical Realism as well as all the essays and short stories I wrote when I still dreamt of becoming a writer. For those curious enough, on page 7 of my very old and cheap copy of La Franja Amarilla, I left the recipe of the tamales I ate every Saturday from 2016 to 2018 when I went with an almost religious conviction to RED’s Peace Breakfasts. I still have very vivid dreams of those tamales and to a lesser degree, of those conversations.
