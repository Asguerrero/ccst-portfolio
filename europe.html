			<h3>Europe</h3> 
		</div>

			<p>If Argentina was a rebirth, my off-campus studies program in Europe was the perfect opportunity to reconnect with that part of myself that always dreamt of traveling around the world. The three months that I spent in the Netherlands, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Poland helped me remember why when I was sixteen I did not hesitate to move 14.000 kilometers away with the sole purpose of learning about other cultures and living my life to the fullest. Europe, with all its imperfections and cosmopolitanism, made me fall in love again with the idea of exploring every single corner of the world. 
			</p>
			<p>In Amsterdam, Berlin, and Prague I made it a habit to do one of my favorite things at least once a week: to walk and get lost in the idiosyncracies of each city. This is how I ended up visiting so many museums, and even attending a street concert in Rotterdam. On all my excursions I made it my goal to continuously reflect on what I was learning and to journal for at least ten minutes while I waited for my food at whichever restaurant I could afford. By the end of the program, I managed to finally fill all the pages of my travel journal. 
			</p>
			<p>Paradoxically, my OCS program also allowed me to reconnect with many people I had not seen in a long time. I visited my cousin in Munich, met up with some of my classmates from Japan, and even had dinner with an old friend from my middle school in Bogota. </p>

			<h2>About this room:</h2>
			<p>This is the smallest room of all. There is a tiny drawer with all the train and museum tickets as well as the copy of Why the Dutch are Different, a book that I got at a store in Rotterdam and that I left in a hotel room in Krakow because my suitcase was already too heavy. Next to the drawer, there is a printed copy of the final draft of my independent research project and a bunch of pamphlets and souvenirs from all the queer and feminist NGOs that we visited. And of course, there is an unlimited supply of Brie and Berliner Weisse.
