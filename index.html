				<p>Welcome to my home! Or to be more precise, a virtual archive of the different ways I define home</p>
				<p>Having left my home country Colombia at 16 years old to study in an international school in Japan, I have spent the past couple of years of my life trying to understand where I fit in. 
				How much time do you have to spend in a place to become part of a community? What responsibilities do I have towards the countries that I have visited or lived in? How do I incorporate what I have learned in different places into my daily life, wherever I am? 
				In simple words, where is home? These are some of the questions that inspired me to build this website and that I hope you will explore with me while you visit my virtual house. 
				</p>

			<h2>The structure of the website</h2>
				<p>Each page represents a country or region to which I think I have a meaningful connection. Even though determining what constitutes a meaningful connection is a complicated process full of ethical and personal considerations, I designed each room to represent a place in which I have spent more than two months and that transformed me, one way or another. Thus, there are five rooms that represent the regions of the world I have either visited or lived in during the last few years, plus a lobby that explains more in-depth how I define home and what inspired me to build this project. </p>
			<p>As you explore each room, you will find four main sections: a short explanation of my general experience, a gallery of artifacts and objects (each with its own story because as Eduardo Galeano said “the world is not made of atoms, the world is made of stories”) and a Spotify playlist that I made during my time in each country. 
				</p>
			<p>So once again, welcome to my house. Feel free to explore the website, either following your intuition or jumping from one room to another in chronological order. </p>
