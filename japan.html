			<p>I got to Narita Airpot in August of 2018. I was jet-lagged and sad. Profoundly and hopelessly sad. I had spent the last thirteen hours crying because I had said goodbye to my mom and my girlfriend and I knew that I was not going to see them for the next ten months. But somehow I was also excited. I was about to start what so many people had described as the adventure of a lifetime. I was officially a student at UWC ISAK Japan and I was going to live for the next two years with two hundred people from more than 100 countries. This combination of confusion, grief, and excitement is what best describes my experience in Japan. 
			</p>
			<p>My time at ISAK was a dream and a nightmare. On the one hand, this school helped me comprehend how big, diverse, and complex the world is. This is the place where I learned about the Velvet revolution in Armenia, the last two dictatorships in Peru, the political crisis in Venezuela, and the colonial history of the CFA franc, all of this just by talking to my friends over hot chocolate. Here is where I understood what it means to be Latine, and where I realized that there are as many rules to play UNO as countries around the globe. Put simply, it is thanks to my time at ISAK that I became a citizen of the world. And I learned all these lessons while traveling around Japan, eating Hawaiian hamburgers at my favorite restaurant with my best friends, and hiking Mount Asama (and semi-active volcano just a couple of kilometers away from campus) 
			</p>
			<p>On the other hand, this is also the place where I discovered, in a very raw way, how profoundly unfair the world is. At ISAK I was reminded on a regular basis of the difference between the Global South and the Global North. It was all about small details like the fact that during winter break all my European friends got to go home and spend Christmas with their families and I had to stay on campus and work. Or the fact that while my classmate from Hong Kong would fly home every weekend, my friend from Venezuela had not seen her family in two years (and would not see them for at least four more years). It was very evident, from the very first week, that even though our teachers pretended that we were all the same (and expected us to perform equally), we were not. I was held to the same standards as my classmates who had attended international schools their entire lives, even when I was still struggling with English and my friends were making fun of my accent. This deliberate and selective blindness to the intricacies of our cultural background, coupled with a lack of access to proper mental health resources, is precisely what made this seemly “inclusive” place a very challenging environment to navigate. 
			</p>
			<p>So when anyone asks me about my time in Japan, I say that it was shocking, confusing, exciting, life-changing, complicated, and fun. Given that I did not speak Japanese, I always felt like I only understood 10% of what was going on around me when I was off campus. However, Japan still somehow feels so familiar. In fact, the more time passes, the more I come to terms with my time at ISAK, and learn to appreciate this unique experience. Nowadays, many little things transport me back to my time in Japan. Sometimes it is a smell that reminds me of the metro in Tokyo or a street that resembles the almost empty neighborhoods in Karuizawa. And I think I can finally say I remember these little details with a mix of nostalgia and gratitude.

			<h2>About this room</h2>
			<p>This room, as my time in Japan, is messy. I avoided visiting it for a couple of years so I am still in the process of organizing all my memories. However, these are some of the objects that I think best represent my relationship with Japan: 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A postcard from my first hike as an OEd leader: During my first year I became an Outdoor Education leader, which just means that I was the student in charge of leading all the hikes and I learned how to use a compass. As the tiny strong Latina woman that I am (this is what my friends would call me every time I stubbornly tried to reach a drawer that was too high), hiking a volcano while carrying 20% of my weight in camping equipment was very challenging. But I learned how to enjoy it and I became so good that I applied to be an OEd leader. In some way, I think this is a metaphor for my first year in Japan: I was trying to reach the top of a very steep mountain and after so many attempts, I finally managed to do it. The question that I sometimes ask myself (which is very similar to what I felt every time I was hiking and why I stopped doing it) is whether it was worth it. Yes, I reached the top but at what cost? </li>
				<li>My Eye drops: A Japanese doctor prescribed me these eye drops because I complained about constant headaches. However, given that I did not speak Japanese and she did not speak English, I never understood what these drops were actually for (I now suspect I had dry eye syndrome, even though judging by the doctor’s look of concern I initially thought that I had a corneal defect). This is just one of one thousand anecdotes about the many things I never understood simply because I do not speak Japanese 
				</li>
				<li>The pillowcase from my first year: While I was moving to my new house in my second year I noticed that there were many marks on my pillowcase. After entertaining some hypotheses, I eventually realized that these were tear marks, very prominent tear marks from all the times I cried during my first year. I still think this pillowcase is a very graphic representation of how miserable and homesick I was during my first few months in Japan</li>
