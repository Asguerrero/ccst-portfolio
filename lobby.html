			<h3>Lobby</h3>

			<p>If this website represents my virtual house, this first room is the lobby, a space specifically designed to prepare you for this  tour. This is when you take your shoes off and I apologize for how messy it is.

			<h2>What is home? Where is it?</h2>
			<p>I have tried to answer this question from very different angles. During my first months in Japan, I thought home was a place and that place was Colombia. Whenever I felt homesick and out of place (which happened quite often) my passport, my accent, and my longing for fried plantains reminded me of the fact that I belonged to a country 14.000 kilometers away from Kauizawa, the small Japanese town I found myself living in. And this was a comforting thought. I knew where I belonged, I knew there was a place I could call home. However, when I finally went back to Colombia for my first summer break, I quickly realized that although everything looked the same, so many things had changed. I had changed. My environment had changed. My family had changed. And what I thought was home, suddenly became so unfamiliar, a feeling that I still have to grapple with whenever I visit Colombia.</p>
			<p>Given that my notion of home as the place I was born in failed to encapsulate my new reality, I decided to rethink my definition. I decided then that my home was my community, or to be more precise, the multiple communities that I am part of: my family, my partner, my friends, and my other support systems. And even though, depending on the day, I still think this is a good definition of home, I have realized that basing my sense of home on the people that surround me leaves me in a very unstable position. Relationships are inherently fluid and my sense of home, something that I think is a core part of my identity, needs to be more solid. Similarly, as I started to have more international experiences -specifically, in Argentina and Europe- I started to perceive the fact that I was constantly moving from one place to another as a rule, not as an exception. In fact, I realized that this almost permanent state of “being on the move” was something that I was actively looking for and not just a situation I found myself in (which is what I used to believe when I was in Japan)
			</p>
			<p>This led me to my most recent answer, and what brings me the most peace, which is the idea that I carry my own home within me. Instead of conceptualizing my almost permanent status as an outsider in terms of what I lack, I have come to the conclusion that my cross-cultural experiences allow me to occupy very unique spaces. I am never going to fit in fully but this does not mean that every time I move to a new place I need to reconstruct my sense of belonging. I already have a clear sense of self and a solid definition of community, wherever I am. This is what it means to carry my own home within me. And given that it has taken me at least five years to come to this definition, I decided to build this website to explore this concept more visually.
