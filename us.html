			<p>I still remember quite clearly my first impression of the Skinner Memorial Chapel, one of the most emblematic buildings from Carleton College. As I saw it for the first time from the window of the Uber that took me from Minneapolis Airport, I thought it looked very majestic and surreal. Everything, in fact, looked surreal. I was in disbelief. Somehow I went from filling out college applications in Japan to becoming a character in one of those American college movies that fascinated me as a child and that I learned to hate as a teenager. I felt both conflicted and excited. What had happened to that idealist teenager who did not even bother to learn English because she never saw herself living in the US, the heart of imperialism and ethnocentrism?  Well, spoiler alert, she had to suck up her pride and learn how to pronounce tater tots in the clearest possible way so she would not have to repeat herself every time she went to the dining hall. 
			</p>
			<p>Every time I think back to my first night at Carleton, I cannot avoid smiling. I felt so thrilled to start this new chapter of my life. To some extent, I felt that I had finally made it. All those nights that I spent studying for my IB exams and the SAT had finally paid off. And yes, my 15-year-old self would probably never understand why I chose to come to the US for undergrad, but I thought it was the right decision. I still do. 
			</p>
			<p>As I approach the last third of my junior year, I think about my time at Carleton in a relatively positive light. Intellectually, I have learned a lot about myself and about other cultures. Living at CASA (the Latinx cultural house), taking SOAN classes, and working at the CCCE has helped me find my own place in an overwhelmingly white environment. Additionally, although I did not really experience a proper cultural shock, my experiences at Carleton have taught me not to think in absolute terms, and instead, to always focus on the nuances and particularities of a given situation. Now, for instance, when I think of the US I do not only think about abstract notions of white supremacy or imperialism but about the Black, queer, Indigenous, and Latinx communities that have found innovative ways to subvert the dominant American culture and reclaim power. And this ability to read between the lines and to challenge the binary is something that I hope to always carry with me as I continue to find my own place in the world.</p>
			<p>However, I also must admit that my Carleton experience has not been exempt from challenges. My first two years were particularly hard. I was hyperaware of my accent in English and I was always hesitant to participate in class discussions. I went from being an extroverted person who was always eager to occupy leadership positions to someone who preferred to not draw much attention to herself. It did not help that I had a hard time finding other students who share my identities because even though there is a vibrant Latinx community on campus, not many people were actually born and raised in Latin America. So as an international student, I felt there was a part of my identity that only a handful of people could relate to. Paradoxically, going to Argentina for the summer and visiting Europe as part of an OCS program my junior fall was exactly what I needed to finally feel like I belong to Carleton. But of course, this story belongs to the next two rooms. </p>

			<h2>About this room</h2>
			<p>This is the most lively room of all. It is full of colorful Hornitos bottles that now serve as a vase for the Friday flowers that my friends have gifted me and it smells like maple syrup. However, given that I have actually spent my time at Carleton doing my best to finish my two majors on time, a big portion of this room is devoted to all my SOAN essays, the whiteboard that I always use for my CS homework, and a copy in English of One Hundred Years of Solitude. I also have my first A on a CS test framed and an infinite pile of all the readings that I have printed for my humanities classes. But outside of this studious and academic area, this room, like all the rooms that I have had at Carleton, is messy. There is a small piece of the beer wall that we built when I lived at the casa that I have been meaning to properly hang for more than two years, as well as a couple of Rotblatt and Sproncert on the floor. I also have a closet with the same ten outfits that I have worn my entire time at Carleton plus the somehow fancy pink shirt I wore housemate's fake wedding during senior week.
